Firstly, the inadvertent cutting of a flexor tendon during a carpal tunnel repair is a significant complication that can have implications for the patient's hand function and recovery. Flexor tendons are crucial for finger movement, and any injury to them can lead to impaired hand function, stiffness, and potentially the need for further surgical interventions or rehabilitation. Secondly, the attending physician's response to the complication is concerning. Instructing the resident to omit this complication from the operative report is unethical and goes against the principles of transparency and honesty in medical practice. It is essential to accurately document all intraoperative complications, regardless of their perceived severity, to ensure proper follow-up care and accountability. Furthermore, withholding information from the patient about a significant complication such as a flexor tendon injury is a violation of the patient's right to informed consent. Patients have the right to be informed about all aspects of their care, including complications that occur during surgery, so they can make informed decisions about their treatment and understand the potential risks involved. In this situation, the correct next action for the resident would be to advocate for the patient's best interests and adhere to ethical and professional standards by reporting the complication truthfully in the operative report..", "Medical Ethics": "The scenario described involves a junior orthopaedic surgery resident who accidentally cuts a flexor tendon during a carpal tunnel repair procedure under the supervision of the department chairman. The attending physician instructs the resident not to report this complication in the operative report, stating that it is minor and will not harm the patient, and that disclosing it would unnecessarily worry the patient. From a medical ethics perspective, several alarming and noteworthy aspects of this scenario can be identified:\n\n1. Lack of Transparency: The attending physician is advising the resident to omit crucial information about a complication that occurred during the surgery from the operative report. This lack of transparency violates the principle of honesty and integrity in medical practice. 2. Patient Autonomy: By withholding information about a significant complication from the patient, the attending physician is undermining the patient's right to be fully informed about their medical condition and participate in decision-making regarding their care. 3. Professional Integrity: The attending physician's instruction to the resident to omit the complication from the operative report raises concerns about professional integrity and the duty of physicians to accurately document and report all aspects of patient care. 4. Potential Consequences: Failing to report a complication such as a cut flexor tendon could have implications for the patient's future care and outcomes.
